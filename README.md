Provides a light-weight client for Twitch chatrooms over IRC. Primarily focused on receiving messages rather than sending them, TwitchIrcClient automatically requests all messages and tags from Twitch and parses these into easy to use classes. Additionally, it provides an event-like interface to receive messages of a specific type, and quality of life features like user tracking and an event for batches of user updates. Future plans include better handling of outgoing messages, providing interfaces to more tags for features like Hype Chats, and a better way to read chat messages with emotes substituted.
